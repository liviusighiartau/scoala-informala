        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p><br>My name is Liviu. I was born in a small city named Dej, but my family was established in a small village near the city so more precisely that's where I'm coming from.
            I'm 27 years old and as many of you guys, I've had a lot of dreams set for my life. Some of them have happened, but in the meantime others have vanished due to 
            circumstancies which we cannot control. I'm a convinced familist, believer and as suggested in the name of the blog, I believe that life is all about enjoying it 
            as much as possible by living in the right and by having the foundation of everything you do on love.</p>
            <br>
        <h3>What I enjoy doing</h3>
            <p>I am passionate about sports, music and of course my work. I really enjoy watching footbal games and from time to time to attend to live games. My favourite team in 
            Romania is Steaua Bucharest and from outside Romania I'm a big FC Barcelona fan. I also like to play football a lot, with my friends, with my work colleagues. 
            I'm also a small adventurer, I like to go hiking on the mountains.
            <br>I really love to spend time in nature with my loved ones or with my friends. My passion for music is something I got when I was born. Both, my mom and dad
            used to play to different instruments, my father was even an orchestra conductor back in the days. I am part of a 150 people choir singing gospel music, you can listen
            to some of our songs by clicking on the following link. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSZ4mcySbYC6hNpB2384FqQ"><span id="hychoir">HYChoir</span></a>)

        <h3>Some serious stuff</h3>
            <p>When it comes to work I quide myself by some principles which I consider very important.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b><span style="color: darkgreen;">Respect</span></b> others because by this you respect yourself.</li>
                <li>Do your work with <b><span style="color: skyblue;">integrity</span></b> and honesty in order to earn respect.</li>
                <li><b><span style="color: steelblue;">Help</span></b> others because by this you help yourself.</li>
                <li>Always be <b><span style="color: purple;">transparent</span></b>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <br>These principles help me not only work related but in every other activity in which I am involved. In the end the details make the difference.
